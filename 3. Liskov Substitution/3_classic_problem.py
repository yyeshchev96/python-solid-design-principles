# according to LSP - Square class should behave similarly to his parent class Reactange
s = Square(2)
s.set_width(2)
s.set_height(4)  # it also overrides width to be 4

"""
What can we do in this case? 
There is no clear solution for this specific example. üßêR. Martin states the following:

    The only way to defend against this kind of LSP violation is to add mechanisms
    to the User (such as an if statement) that detects whether the Rectangle is, in
    fact, a Square. Since the behavior of the User depends on the types it uses, those
    types are not substitutable.
